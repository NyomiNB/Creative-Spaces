        <h2> Katonah Art Center </h2>
        <h3> Visual Arts - Pottery </h3>
        <p>Katonah Art Center is located in Mount Kisco, just north of New York City. It offers a variety of classes for various art forms, the most prominent ones being painting and pottery. I can attest to their pottery program, as I've attended it for two years myself, that it is well equipped with the tools you need to learn pottery or perfect your craft. The teachers are serious about their work, but very kind and eager to help new students. They have a diverse array of programs for children, and even camps to engage students in art during the summer. </p>

        <h2> How to get started </h2>
        <p> For pottery, it is best to start at a studio where the equipment is already set up for you. Guided instruction is the most helpful for beginners, but if you're an adult looking to hone their skills, consider taking adult pottery classes where you can work with others of your age group. </p>
